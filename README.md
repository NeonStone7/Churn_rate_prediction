What is the churn rate?


Wikipedia states that the churn rate (also called attrition rate) measures the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. It applies in many contexts, but the mainstream understanding of churn rate is related to the business case of customers that stop buying from you.
Software as a service (SaaS) with its subscription-based business model and membership- based businesses are at the forefront of innovative customer retention strategies. Analyzing growth in this space might involve tracking metrics (like revenues, new customer ratio, etc.), performing customer segmentation analysis, and predicting lifetime value. The churn rate is an input of customer lifetime value modeling that guides the estimation of net profit contributed to the whole future relationship with a customer. Independently, it calculates the percentage of discontinuity in subscriptions by customers of a service or product within a given time frame.<br>

This translates to revenue loss via customer cancellation. Market saturation is quite evident in the SaaS market, there are always plenty of alternatives for any SaaS product. Studying the churn rate can help with Knowing-Your-Customer and effective retention and marketing strategies for subscription-driven businesses.
